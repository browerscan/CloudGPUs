<h1>NVIDIA A100 80GB Cloud Pricing (2025) - Compare Providers</h1>

<section class="seo-intro">
  <p>
    The <strong>NVIDIA A100 80GB</strong> remains the workhorse GPU for machine learning workloads
    in 2025. Despite the introduction of H100 and H200, the A100 80GB continues to be widely used
    across cloud providers due to its excellent balance of memory capacity, bandwidth, and
    cost-effectiveness. For teams training medium-sized large language models, running inference at
    scale, or processing data-intensive workloads, the A100 80GB offers sufficient VRAM to handle
    batch processing and model parallelization without the premium pricing of newer generation GPUs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cloud providers offer A100 80GB instances in both SXM and PCIe form factors, with pricing
    typically ranging from $2.50 to $4.50 per GPU-hour depending on provider, region, and whether
    you choose on-demand or spot pricing. The A100 80GB's 2TB/s memory bandwidth and NVLink support
    make it particularly suitable for multi-GPU training configurations where fast inter-GPU
    communication is critical.

<h2>Best Use Cases for A100 80GB</h2>
<section class="seo-use-cases">
  <p>The A100 80GB excels in several machine learning and data science scenarios:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Training Medium-Sized LLMs:</strong> 80GB of VRAM comfortably fits models up to 70B
      parameters with optimization techniques like Flash Attention and quantization, making it ideal
      for fine-tuning LLaMA, Mistral, and similar models.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Production Inference:</strong> For serving large language models, the A100 80GB
      provides sufficient memory to host multiple instances with KV cache, enabling high throughput
      without frequent offloading.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Science:</strong> The large VRAM capacity supports processing of massive datasets
      in-memory, reducing the need for data batching and accelerating ETL workflows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multi-GPU Training:</strong> With NVLink support, multiple A100s can be interconnected
      for distributed training, achieving near-linear scaling for many workloads.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<h2>Why Choose A100 Over H100? Value Proposition</h2>
<section class="seo-value-prop">
  <p>
    While the H100 offers superior performance with its Transformer Engine and Hopper architecture,
    the A100 80GB delivers <strong>40-60% lower hourly costs</strong> across most cloud providers.
    For workloads that don't require the absolute fastest training times, the A100 provides
    significantly better price-performance. Many teams find that the A100's 80GB VRAM is actually
    more practical than the H100's 80GB variant due to mature software ecosystem support and wider
    availability across cloud platforms.
  </p>

<h2>A100 80GB Cloud Provider Comparison</h2>
<section class="seo-provider-comparison">
  <p>When comparing A100 cloud pricing across providers, consider these factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>On-Demand vs Spot:</strong> Spot pricing can reduce costs by 50-70%, but instances may
      be preempted with short notice.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multi-GPU Discounts:</strong> Some providers offer discounted rates for 4-GPU or 8-GPU
      instances, which can be more economical than individual GPUs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Regional Pricing:</strong> US regions typically have the lowest rates, while EU and
      Asia-Pacific regions may carry 10-30% premiums.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hidden Costs:</strong> Factor in storage, network egress, and any minimum commit
      requirements when calculating total cost.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Use the comparison table above to filter by spot availability, minimum rental duration, and
    provider reputation to find the best A100 80GB rental option for your needs.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<section class="seo-faq">
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is the typical A100 80GB cloud price per hour?</h3>
    <p>
      On-demand A100 80GB pricing typically ranges from $2.50 to $4.50 per GPU-hour across major
      cloud providers. Spot instances can be found for $1.00 to $2.00 per hour, though availability
      varies significantly by provider and region.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How much VRAM do I need for LLM training?</h3>
    <p>
      For training, a rough rule is 2GB VRAM per billion parameters for full precision. The A100
      80GB can comfortably train models up to 40B parameters at full precision or 70B+ with
      quantization and gradient checkpointing. For fine-tuning, 80GB handles most open-source LLMs
      up to 70B parameters.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Is A100 80GB better than H100 for my workload?</h3>
    <p>
      H100 is 2-3x faster for training with its Transformer Engine, but costs 60-80% more per hour.
      Choose A100 if budget is constrained, your workload doesn't benefit from H100's specific
      optimizations, or you need wider availability across providers.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is the difference between A100 SXM and PCIe?</h3>
    <p>
      SXM variants offer higher TDP (600W vs 400W), faster GPU-to-GPU communication via NVLink
      (600GB/s vs PCIe Gen4 x16), and are typically used in multi-GPU training nodes. PCIe variants
      are more flexible and suitable for single-GPU workloads or inference.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How many A100s do I need for distributed training?</h3>
    <p>
      For optimal performance, use multiples of 8 GPUs (standard DGX/A100 node configuration). Two
      A100s with NVLink can achieve ~1.8x speedup over single GPU, while 8 GPUs typically achieve
      6-7x scaling. The exact speedup depends on model architecture and framework optimization.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Can I rent A100 80GB for short-term projects?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, most providers offer hourly billing with no long-term commitment. Some specialize in
      short-term rentals with per-minute billing and instant provisioning, which is ideal for
      experiments, hackathons, or burst inference workloads.
